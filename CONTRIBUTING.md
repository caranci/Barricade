# Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome!

When creating a pull request, keep in mind the following:
- Pull requests should be made from your own fork (since, well, you won't have access to the repository!)
- Pull requests should target the `experimental` branch - `master` is only for features that have been fully tested and are final
- Pull requests should be tested prior to being created
- If you are working on a pull request, consider opening an Issue so that we can track progress and provide early feedback!
