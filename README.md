The Hell Let Loose Bunker is a service by server admins for server admins, to protect their servers from cheaters and troublemakers through collaborative data sharing. Receive reports created by verified admins and apply bans with a single button press through seamless integration with your favorite admin tools.

Only verified communities can use Bunker. Visit [the Server Hosting Discord](https://discord.gg/Pm5WfhB) to register your community.

## Setting up your community

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your community to receive reports, make sure you have the following;
- You are the owner of a registered community. You can register in [the Server Hosting Discord](https://discord.gg/Pm5WfhB).
- You have Manage Server rights on the Discord server you want to receive reports in.

### Steps

1. #### Invite HLL Bunker to your Discord server.

    Use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1190718626286813244&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=35840) (TODO: Update permissions) to invite the Discord bot. Allow it all the requested permissions. Bunker won't be able to operate properly without them.

2. #### Configure which channel reports need to be sent to.

    Use the `/set-reports-channel` command in your Discord server to assign a text channel. Make sure that it is a **private** channel. Anyone that is able to read the channel will be able to respond to reports and (un)ban players!
